# Diatomic-PEC-Genetic-algohritm
This is the repository with source code and data associated with the article "Genetic algorithm for obtaining potential energy curve of diatomic molecules based on dispersed
fluorescence spectra"

The file Code_of_genetic_algorithm.ipynb  contains the source code of our algorithm

The file BcontExpLevels.txt contains energies of maxima of bound->free transitions observed in experimental spectrum of G->X transition in Hg_2 molecule (compare Fig. 6 in the article). According to the adopted assumptions (compare the text of 
manuscript or source code of the genetic algorithm), the energy of the first maximum in the spectrum was subtracted from the energies of all maxima.

Both files can be directly used with algorithm from Code_of_genetic_algorithm.ipynb
